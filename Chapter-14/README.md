# Practical Project: Automated Maintenance and Deployment
Let's build a comprehensive maintenance and deployment system that combines scheduled tasks, application management, and system health checks—production automation demonstrating this chapter's concepts.



# Key Features
This script transforms manual maintenance and deployment into an automated, repeatable process.
•	Scheduled Task Creation: Automatically configures recurring maintenance operations (disk cleanup, health checks).
•	Dynamic Script Generation: Creates maintenance scripts on the fly for disk cleanup and system health monitoring.
•	Remote Application Deployment: Pushes software installers to remote computers and handles installation silently.
•	Verification and Error Handling: Checks for prerequisites, tests network connectivity, and validates installation exit codes.
•	Comprehensive Logging: Records all actions, successes, and failures to a timestamped log file.
•	HTML Reporting: Generates a user-friendly HTML report summarizing all operations performed.
•	Modular Design: Allows for selective execution—run only task creation, only deployment, or both.

# How to Use the System
Save the code as MaintenanceDeployment.ps1 and run it from a PowerShell terminal with administrator rights.

## EXAMPLE 1: Create scheduled maintenance tasks on the local machine only.
.\MaintenanceDeployment.ps1 -CreateScheduledTasks

## EXAMPLE 2: Deploy an application to the local machine only.
.\MaintenanceDeployment.ps1 -InstallerPath "C:\Installers\Application.msi"

## EXAMPLE 3: Create tasks AND deploy an application to multiple remote computers.
.\MaintenanceDeployment.ps1 -CreateScheduledTasks -ComputerName "SERVER01", "SERVER02", "WORKSTATION03" -InstallerPath "C:\Installers\App.msi"

## EXAMPLE 4: Deploy an application to remote computers only, without creating tasks.
.\MaintenanceDeployment.ps1 -ComputerName "SERVER01", "SERVER02" -InstallerPath "C:\Installers\App.msi"
