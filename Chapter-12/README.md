# Practical Project: Service Health Check Script
you'll build a comprehensive service health monitoring script that checks critical services, validates dependencies, monitors resources, and generates detailed reports—production-ready automation for system monitoring.

## Using the script:
```
# Run with defaults
.\ServiceHealthCheck.ps1


# Monitor custom services
.\ServiceHealthCheck.ps1 -CriticalServices @("IIS", "MSSQLSERVER", "W3SVC")


# Schedule to run hourly via Task Scheduler

```

This production-ready script demonstrates comprehensive system monitoring: service status checking, dependency validation, resource monitoring, alerting, HTML report generation, and detailed logging. Deploy this on servers to catch issues before they impact users—real professional monitoring automation.
