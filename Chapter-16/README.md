# Practical Project: System Health Monitoring Dashboard
Let's build a comprehensive system health monitoring dashboard that continuously monitors event logs, system resources, services, and generates visual reports—production-ready monitoring automation combining all concepts from this chapter.


# Using the health monitoring dashboard:

## Single health check
.\HealthMonitor.ps1 -ComputerName "SERVER01"

## Monitor multiple servers
.\HealthMonitor.ps1 -ComputerName "SERVER01","SERVER02","WEB01","WEB02"

## Continuous monitoring with 5-minute intervals
.\HealthMonitor.ps1 -ComputerName "SERVER01","SERVER02" -ContinuousMode -CheckIntervalMinutes 5

## Monitor with custom output path
.\HealthMonitor.ps1 -ComputerName "SERVER01" -OutputPath "D:\Monitoring"

This production-ready monitoring dashboard demonstrates comprehensive system health automation: multi-system monitoring with CIM queries for hardware metrics, event log analysis for critical errors and service failures, disk space and resource threshold alerting, visual HTML dashboard with color-coded status indicators, continuous monitoring mode for real-time health tracking, detailed logging of all checks and alerts, and modular design enabling easy threshold and metric customization. It combines event logs, WMI/CIM, service monitoring, and resource tracking into unified infrastructure health visibility—real operational intelligence for proactive system management.
