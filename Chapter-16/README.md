# Practical Project: Multi-Server Configuration Script
Let's build a comprehensive multi-server configuration system that demonstrates production remoting automation. This script configures multiple servers simultaneously, verifies configurations, handles errors gracefully, and generates detailed reports—real enterprise infrastructure management.



## Using the multi-server configuration script:
```

# Report mode - check configurations without changes
.\MultiServerConfig.ps1 -ComputerName "SERVER01","SERVER02","SERVER03" -ReportOnly

# Configure all settings on servers
.\MultiServerConfig.ps1 -ComputerName "SERVER01","SERVER02","SERVER03" -ConfigurationType All

# Configure only services
.\MultiServerConfig.ps1 -ComputerName "WEB01","WEB02","WEB03" -ConfigurationType Services

# Configure security settings only
.\MultiServerConfig.ps1 -ComputerName "WORKSTATION01","WORKSTATION02" -ConfigurationType Security

```
This production-ready script demonstrates enterprise remoting automation: parallel execution across multiple servers, connectivity validation before attempting operations, modular configuration types enabling selective application, report-only mode for validation without changes, comprehensive error handling and logging, detailed HTML reporting with status tracking, system information collection for inventory, and graceful handling of offline servers. It transforms hours of manual server configuration into minutes of automated, consistent deployment—real infrastructure-as-code managing servers at scale.
